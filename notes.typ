= Various Digital SAT Math Notes

Various notes based on various resources (refer to #link(label("bibliography"))[bibliography]). Authored by #link("https://www.mueezkhan.com")[Mueez Khan].

#info(title: "What is the Digital SAT?")[
  - An exam taken on a laptop or tablet, using #link("https://bluebook.app.collegeboard.org/")[Bluebook]
  - About 2 hours long
  - Allows the use of a calculator on the entire math section
  You may learn more about the Digital SAT from College Board and Khan Academy.
]

#idea(title: "Tip!")[Two methods you may prep for the Digital SAT are:
- Taking *full-length practice tests* (for example using College Board's #link("https://bluebook.app.collegeboard.org/")[Bluebook app])
- *Practicing skills* (for example by using #link("https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/v2-sat-math")[Khan Academy] to read articles, watch videos, and do exercises)
I also suggest watching *online videos* of instructors going through practice problems. You can pause videos and try to solve the problem yourself before continuing the video to learn the instructor's solution. This way you can get instant feedback on your work, and you'll be able to learn from the instructor's explanation.
